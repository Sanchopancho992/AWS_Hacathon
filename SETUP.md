2. Type "Tasks: Run Task" and press Enter
3. Select "Start Both Servers"

Your Hong Kong Tourism AI is now running! Try asking it:
- "What are the best dim sum places in Central?"
- "Plan a 2-day itinerary for a food lover"
- "How do I get to Victoria Peak?"

## ðŸ”§ If Something Goes Wrong

### "Location not supported" error?
- Use a VPN to connect from the US or another supported region
- Or try switching to a different Google account

### Frontend won't start?
- Make sure you have Node.js installed
- Try running `npm install` in the frontend folder first

### Backend won't start?
- Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed
- Try running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the backend folder first

### Still having issues?
- Check that your API key is correct in the `.env` file
- Make sure both servers show "startup complete" messages
- Try restarting VS Code and running the tasks again

## ðŸ“± Using the App

### On Desktop
- Use the top navigation to switch between features
- Chat, plan trips, translate text, and get recommendations

### On Mobile  
- Use the bottom navigation for easy thumb access
- Tap the camera icon in translation to scan menus and signs

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Ask specific questions**: Instead of "tell me about Hong Kong", ask "best street food in Mong Kok"
- **Use the camera**: Point it at Chinese text for instant translation
- **Set your preferences**: The more you tell it about your interests, the better recommendations you'll get
- **Save favorites**: Use the itinerary planner to save places you want to visit
